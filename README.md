# ProxmoxOnedriveBackup
This is my stuggles (successful) with Proxmox version 8.3.3 to connect it with Microsoft OneDrive disk (e.g., from Microsoft 365) as additional storage for backups, ISOs, templates, etc. 
The soluton uses RCLONE package its installation, configuration, connection wth OneDrive, sychronization between Proxmox <-> OneDrive.
I acknowledge that the solution presented is far from being perfect, but it works. If you have any suggestions on how to improve it, feel free to share.
